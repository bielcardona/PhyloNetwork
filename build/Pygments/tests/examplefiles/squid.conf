# First, a comment block for the deafult conf:

#  TAG: buffered_logs   on|off
#       cache.log log file is written with stdio functions, and as such
#       it can be buffered or unbuffered. By default it will be unbuffered.
#       Buffering it can speed up the writing slightly (though you are
#       unlikely to need to worry unless you run with tons of debugging
#       enabled in which case performance will suffer badly anyway..).
#
#Default:
# buffered_logs off

# Now, a slightly useful (but in no way complete) set of options:
